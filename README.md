# Google Scholar Clone
An application designed to mirror the looks and some of the functionalities of Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en&as_sdt=0,5). It is built using React, TypeScript and SCSS.

# Project Status
This project is currently under development phase. A future filter by date module is needed to sort the results based on publisher year or year range provided (e.g. between 2015 - 2022). 

# Installation and Setup Instructions

Example: Clone down this repository. You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

Installation:

```npm install```

To Start Server:

```npm start```

# Reflection
This project is intended to be a low scale copy of Google Scholar. I've built the CSS based on Google Scholar patterns and color palletes. Also, the app uses Google Scholar API for fetching articles or books based on a value the user provides in the main search input.

After some tutorials and reading about TypeScript I've decided to integrate both TypeScript and SCSS knowledge into this personal project. Among the technologies and features used we recall ```redux```, ```react context```, ```react routing```, ```SCSS```.
